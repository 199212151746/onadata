<p>
  To start a new survey enter a Title and ID String. When the
  surveyor opens the survey in ODK Collect they will see the Title
  first. The ID String is used internally to link survey submissions
  to this survey. XLS2XForm will automatically add a version
  identifier onto the ID String to make sure each version of your
  survey is uniquely identified.
