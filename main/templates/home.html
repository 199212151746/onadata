formhub is a <strong>free</strong> hosted service that aims to make the whole data collection process <strong>simpler</strong> and <strong>more collaborative</strong></em>.
</p>
<p>
formhub makes data collection simpler by making survey authoring simple, and by providing a hosted site in which going from authored survey to data is quick and painless (no technical understanding required).  formhub works seemlessly with <a href="http://www.opendatakit.org">ODK Collect</a> a robust and proven data collection platform for Android.  
</p>
<p>
formhub makes data collection more <strong>collaborative</strong> by making it possible to author surveys/forms in Excel. Being both human-accessible and machine-readable makes XLSforms the ideal format for sharing forms that you quickly want to deploy.
